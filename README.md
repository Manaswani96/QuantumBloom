> **Quantum Bloom Studio** is a modern JavaFX application designed for the interactive visualization of quantum wavefunctions and core concepts in quantum mechanics. Optimized for clarity, performance, and a dark theme aesthetic.

---

## Features

- Real-time wavefunction rendering (real, imaginary, probability)
- System selector: infinite potential well, harmonic oscillator, and superposition states
- Dynamic parameter controls: energy level `n`, box length `L`, and superposition weights
- Animated time evolution with phase and amplitude tracking
- Modular plots: expectation values, phase space, energy levels
- Dark-themed, distraction-free UI with gradient accents
- Save/load system state support via `.properties` file
- Prepared for future extension (e.g., quantum tunneling, scattering)
